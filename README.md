Smart-Presence: Flask-Based Attendance Management System

Smart-Presence is a web-based Attendance Management System developed using Python and the Flask framework, designed to simplify and automate the process of tracking student attendance in educational institutions. The system offers a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface that ensures smooth usability for both faculty and students.

The application includes secure role-based modules for students and faculty, enabling controlled access and efficient attendance management. Faculty members can record attendance digitally, while the system provides real-time attendance status tracking, reducing errors and eliminating manual record-keeping.

To improve communication and accountability, Smart-Presence integrates automated WhatsApp notifications, instantly alerting students when they are marked absent. This feature helps students stay informed and encourages timely corrective action.

Built with a focus on efficiency and reliability, Smart-Presence streamlines attendance workflows, minimizes administrative effort, and enhances interaction between faculty and students, making it suitable for real-world academic environments.
